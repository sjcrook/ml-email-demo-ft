These SPEs seem to be structured in a way that allows Enron to avoid consolidating their debt, giving a false impression of the company's financial health.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, I have encountered questionable accounting treatments related to energy trading contracts, where mark-to-market accounting is being used to recognize future profits prematurely.
